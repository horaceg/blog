![Monthly Payments: loan & interest](monthly_payments.png)

As a young-ish professional, I've been wondering whether I should buy my primary residence or keep renting. With this thought, I've been driven to answer this question in a rational manner.

You can see the results of this investigation on this website: [linemo](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/).

## Loan interest rates

It all started when I wanted to know how much I would pay in interest for a loan. Because let's face it, the interest rate is super _opaque_ about how much interest I would pay over the life of the loan. One might, naively, think that a 4% interest rate means that I would pay 4% of the principal in interest over the life of the loan (In a loan, the principal is the original amount of money you borrow, not including any interest or fees).


However, this is not the case. The interest rate is applied to the remaining balance of the loan, every month. This means that the interest you pay decreases over time ; but the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan is way higher than 4% of the principal.

So I've built a simple [loan simulator](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/loan) to answer this question.

### Case study : contracting a loan


Let's assume that I pay every month 1,500€ over 20 years. The amount of the loan is 266,000€. 

According to the current interest rates around 3.2%, I would pay 94 000€ in interest over the life of the loan ; or around 35% of the principal. Note that this is way more than the 4% of the principal that one may naively think.

[Here is the case study](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/loan?mode=mp&monthly=1500&loan=165&duration=20&rate=3.2).

Now that we understand how a loan works, let's move on to the next question: should I buy a home, to live in, or rent it ?

## Buy or rent?


You generally have 2 options:

- Buy a home (to live in)
- Rent a home

The question is: which option is better for you in the short, medium, and long run ? 

Surprisingly, the answer is not obvious. At a first glance, it seems that buying a home is always better: instead of **throwing money away** by renting, you are **investing** in your own home. However, this is not always the case, mostly because of the costs associated with buying a home: **agency fees** and **closing costs**.

Agency fees are typically "paid by the seller"  to the agency that helps them sell their home. Closing costs are the costs associated with the purchase of a home, such as notary fees, registration fees, etc. When summing up both costs, it is possible that the total cost of buying a home is higher than the total cost of renting a home. 
This means that for every transaction, you are **losing money** by buying a home. Now, it _could_ be worth it _if you stay long enough_. How long ? This is the question that the [buy or rent](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/buy-vs-rent) calculator answers.

### Case study : renting or buying an apartment in France - fall 2025

[Here is a realistic scenario](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/buy-vs-rent?mode=mp&monthly=1500&loan=309&duration=25&rate=3.2&rent=1200&rentInc=1&savingsRoi=6&tax=30&down=15&appreciation=1&closing=7.7&agency=5&extras=50&propertyTax=1000&maintenance=150).

As you can see, the conclusion is: _Wait 15.2 years for buying to overtake renting_. So in this scenario, buying is better than renting ONLY if you stay in the apartment for more than 15.2 years.

Of course, there are many assumptions here that may not be true, especially since they are based on future values. For instance: the rent increase, the evolution of real estate prices, the Return on investment (ROI) of the savings, the tax rate, etc.

However, this calculator let's you play with the assumptions to see how the result changes.

## The math

[Here is the math behind the calculator](https://linemo.horaceg.xyz/how-it-works). In a nutshell, thanks to arithmetico-geometric series, we can compute all the interest payments, and the total amount of interest paid over the life of the loan.


## Conclusion

All in all, this calculator is a tool to help you make decisions. It is not perfect, but it can be a useful tool to help:

- Understand how a loan works, and how many interest you will pay
- Understand the costs associated with buying / renting a home
- Understand the impact of the assumptions on the result
- Make a decision based on the results
